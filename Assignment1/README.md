# Feedforward Neural Network using Keras & TensorFlow

This assignment implements a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.  
The model learns to identify clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags based on grayscale images.
